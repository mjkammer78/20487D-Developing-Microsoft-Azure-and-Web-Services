# Lab: Implement an Azure Function 

### Exercise 1: Developing the Service Locally

#### Task 1: Create a new Function App project in Visual Studio

1. Open the Command Prompt window.
2. At the command prompt, change the directory by pasting the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
    cd [RepositoryRoot]\AllFiles\Mod05\Labfiles\Exercise4
    ```
3.  Install the following package:
    ```bash
        npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@core --unsafe-perm true
    ```  
4.  To create a local Functions project, paste the following command:
    ```bash
        func init BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy -n --worker-runtime dotnet
    ```
5.  To change the directory to the newly created function project folder, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        cd BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy
    ```
6.  To open the project in Visual Studio Code, paste the following command, and then press Enter: 
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
7. Right-click the **BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy** folder, point to **Add**, and then seelect **New File**.
8.  In the **File name** box, enter **Traveler.cs**, and then click **Enter**.
9.  In **Traveler.cs**, paste the following code:
    ```bash
    using System;

    namespace BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy
    {
       public class Traveler
       {
    	  public int TravelerId { get; set; }
          public string FirstName { get; set; }
          public string LastName { get; set; }
          public string MobilePhone { get; set; }
          public string Passport { get; set; }
          public string Email { get; set; }
       }
    }
    ```
10. To create a new Azure function for your new Functions project, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
    func new --name BookFlightFunc
     ```
11.  In **Select a template**, select **HttpTrigger**.


#### Task 2: Implement an HTTP trigger that invokes the flights booking Web App

1. In your new **BookFlightFunc** class, locate the **using** assemblies, and then after the last **using** which is **Newtonsoft.Json**, press Enter.
2. In the new line after **using Newtonsoft.Json**, add the following **using** assemblies:
    ```
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```
3. Replace all the **Run** method implementations with the following code that makes a request to the **Flights booking** web app, which you have created in Lab 2:
    ```cs
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request to the flights booking service.");

    var flightId = req.Query["flightId"];

    var flightServiceUrl = $"http://blueyonder-flights-{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights/bookFlight?flightId={flightId}";

    log.LogInformation($"Flights service url:{flightServiceUrl}");

    var travelers = new List<Traveler>
     {
        new Traveler { Email = "204837Dazure@gmail.com" , FirstName = "Jonathan", LastName = "James", MobilePhone = "+61 0658748", Passport = "204837DCBA" },
        new Traveler { Email = "204837Dfunction@gmail.com", FirstName = "James", LastName = "Barkal", MobilePhone = "+61 0658355", Passport = "204837DCBABC" }
     };

    var travelersAsJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(travelers);

    using (var client = new HttpClient())
    {
        client.PostAsync(flightServiceUrl,
                         new StringContent(travelersAsJson,
                                           Encoding.UTF8,
                                           "application/json")).Wait();
    }

    return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Request to book flight was sent successfully");
    ```
    >**Note**: Replace *{Your Initials}* in the **flightServiceUrl** with your actual initials.

#### Task 3: Test the Function App locally in a browser

1.  to test the new Azure function locally, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        func host start --build
    ```
2. Open a browser and navigate to **http://localhost:7071/api/BookFlightFunc?flightId=1**.
3. Check whether you are getting the expected response such as the following:
    ```
    Request to book flight was sent successfully
    ```
1. To check whether the travelers were actually booked to flight number 1, open a browser and navigate to **http://blueyonder-flights-{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights**.

    >**Note**: Replace *{Your Initials}* with your actual initials.

2. Check whether you are getting the expected response such as the following:
    ```json
    [{"flightId":1,"origin":"New York","destination":"Paris","flightNumber":"204837D","departureTime":"2018-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[{"travelerId":1,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":2,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"}]},{"flightId":2,"origin":"Paris","destination":"Rome","flightNumber":"204837C","departureTime":"2017-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[]}]
    ```    


### Exercise 2: Deploying the Service to Azure Functions

#### Task 1: Deploy the service to Azure Functions from Visual Studio

1. Open a browser and navigate to the Azure Portal.
2. If a page appears asking for your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Continue**. Wait for the sign-in page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.

    >**Note**: During the sign-in process, if a page appears asking you to choose from a list of previously used accounts, select the account that you previously used, and then continue to provide your credentials.

3. If the **Windows Azure Tour** dialog box appears, click **X** (the close button).
4. In the navigation blade, click **Create a resource**.
5. In the **New** window, select **Compute**, and then select **Function App**.
6. In the **Function App** blade, in the **App name** box, enter a globally unique name.
    >**Note**: Save the app name in any code editor. You will need it when publishing the new Azure function to Azure.
7. From the **Location** list, select the region that is closest to your location.
8. Set **Application Insights** to **Off**.
9. Click **Create**. Wait for the Functions app to be created.
10. Open the Command Prompt window.
11. At the command prompt, change the directory by pasting the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        cd [RepositoryRoot]\AllFiles\Mod05\Labfiles\Exercise4\BlueYonder.Flights.GroupProxy
    ```
12. To test the new Azure function locally, paste the following command. and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        func host start --build
    ```
13. To sign in to Azure with your credentials before publishing the new Azure function to Azure, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        az login
    ```
    >**Note**: You will get the following message: **To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code** {some code} **to authenticate​**. Follow the instructions to sign in with your username and password.
14. To publish your new Azure function into Azure, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```bash
        func azure functionapp publish {Your App name}
    ```             
    >**Note**: Replace **{Your App name}** with your actual app name in Azure that you wrote in previous step.
    
#### Task 2: Test the Function App on Azure in a browser 

1. Open a browser and navigate to **https://{Your App Name}.azurewebsites.net/api/BookFlightFunc?flightId=1**.
    >**Note**: Replace **{Your App Name}** with your App name.
	
	Note: cannot be done using current portal, as calls to function require (default) api key. Extend the query string accordingly or use the 'code and test' tab to perform a GET.
	
2. Check whether you are getting the expected response such as the following:
	```cs
    Request to book flight was sent successfully
    ```
3. To check whether the travelers were actually booked to flight number 1, open a browser and navigate to **http://blueyonder-flights-{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights**.

    >**Note**: Replace **{Your Initials}** with your actual initials.

4. Check whether you are getting the expected response such as the following:
    ```json
    [{"flightId":1,"origin":"New York","destination":"Paris","flightNumber":"204837D","departureTime":"2018-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[{"travelerId":1,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":2,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":3,"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"James","mobilePhone":"+61 0658748","passport":"204837DCBA","email":"204837Dazure@gmail.com"},{"travelerId":4,"firstName":"James","lastName":"Barkal","mobilePhone":"+61 0658355","passport":"204837DCBABC","email":"204837Dfunction@gmail.com"}]},{"flightId":2,"origin":"Paris","destination":"Rome","flightNumber":"204837C","departureTime":"2017-10-10T00:00:00","travelers":[]}]
    ```
    >**Note**: You are seeing the same travelers that you had added earlier (locally) but with different **Traveler IDs**.
