# Module 8: Diagnostics and Monitoring

1. Wherever you see a path to file starting at **[Repository Root]**, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides.
   e.g. - you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, then the following path: *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** will become **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever you see **{YourInitials}**, replace it with your actual initials. For example, the initials for **John Doe** will be **jd**).
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Microsoft Azure resources required for the demonstration. It is recommended to review the demonstrations before the actual class and identify the resources and then prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.
